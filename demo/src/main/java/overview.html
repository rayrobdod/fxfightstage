		The `demo` subproject contains an application that allows a user to set
		parameters to a BattleAnimation, then play that animation. The main class for
		this application is `name.rayrobdod.fightStage.previewer.Main`, and it uses two
		Service Providers to find implementations of `UnitAnimationGroup` and
		`SpellAnimationGroup`, so one could use this with a different classpath to view
		custom animation groups.
