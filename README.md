The goal of this project is to replicate the "FightStage" of
https://github.com/eliatlarge/FEMultiPlayer-V2 in JavaFX.

Primarily because we keep finding people which have graphics cards incapable of running FEMP-V2.

[ ] Create at least three classes of animations
  [x] one of which should include a magic cast animation
  [ ] include a way to optionally modify the animation in case of e.g. critical hit, skill trigger, finisher
[ ] Include HP decrementing animations
  [x] Screen shake on any hit
  [x] the extruding spark things on a hit without a different hit effect
  [ ] Maybe including a NO DAMAGE text animation thing 
  [ ] Probably not any critical or miss animations though
[ ] Units starting combat by walking towards the other FE4/FE9 style (as opposed to the current FEGBA or FE1 style) (enhancement?)
[ ] Units start a distance away from each other (depending on distance in tiles on a theoretical board)
[ ] Ideally shouldn't hardcode too much
