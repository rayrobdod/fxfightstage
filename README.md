The goal of this project is to replicate the "FightStage" of
https://github.com/eliatlarge/FEMultiPlayer-V2 in JavaFX.

Primarily because we keep finding people which have graphics cards incapable of running FEMP-V2.

[ ] be able to switch between three at least different attack animations
  [ ] one of which should include a magic cast animation
[ ] Include HP decrementing animations
  [ ] Maybe including a NO DAMAGE text animation thing 
  [ ] Probably not any critical or miss animations though
[ ] Units starting combat by walking towards the other FE4/FE9 style (as opposed to the current FEGBA or FE1 style) (enhancement?)
[ ] Ideally shouldn't hardcode too much
