		The `core` subproject contains the things needed by a dependent project. The
		entry point of the library is {@link name.rayrobdod.fightStage.BattleAnimation#buildAnimation};
		all that method's inputs are its parameters, and it returns a Node and Animation
		which can be added to a Scene and played, respectively. The primary extension
		point is implementing {@link name.rayrobdod.fightStage.UnitAnimationGroup} and {@link name.rayrobdod.fightStage.SpellAnimationGroup} and
		providing those custom implementations in `buildAnimation`'s parameters.
